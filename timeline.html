                <p>My first semester, I took 17 credits of wildly different classes, attempting 
                    to find something that really interested me. The problem was, everything interested me. I had 
                    a really hard time finding one subject that interested me more than all the others. Thankfully 
                    in my first year I took my first Computer Science course. I knew immediately that this was going
                    to be my major. The next hard part was finding a specialization. <br>

                    I started working at the dining hall as a way to continue having a source of income to help pay for
                    school. I would end up becoming a manager here and working until I graduated.

                <p> Knowing that I wanted to do Computer Science, I began taking pre-requisites for the major. This is the year where 
                    took my first data structures class, and really started learning c++, which all of my classes were in. I also decided in 
                    my second year that French was something that I really enjoyed learning, and wanted to make a life skill, so I decided to
                    make it my minor in hopes of becoming as fluent as possible.

                <p> This was the first year that I was really able to start exploring the different classes available to me.
                    I took an advanced algorithms and data structures class, a computer organization class, and a class on the 
                    foundations of computer science. At this point I had only taken classes in c++, so taking classes that explored 
                    how computers operate, writing code in assembly and how the linker operates and how it translates the c++ code I'm used to
                    writing into machine readable code, and how pipelines of instructions work to execute that assembly... I know that
                    I'm rambling, but this was the year that I really confirmed that initial decision to pursue Computer Science. <br>

                    The more I knew, the more I knew that I didn't know. There is a continually receding horizon of knowledge in 
                    Computer Science, and all of it is fascinating to me.

                <p>In my last year, I took several different classes, still searching for one field that eclipsed all the others as my 
                    favorite. I took Security, Operating Systems, Artifical Intelligence, Web Systems, and finally Human Centered SW design.
                    While I enjoyed all of my classes, and the opportunites to learn Python, HTML, JavaScript, and a passable amount of Go,
                    designing Web Systems was certainly the most fascinating to me, albeit not the most intuitive. I worked hard, and I learned
                    a lot. Learning to create client side and server side dynamic pages, and host them on Amazon W3 was immensely rewarding.<br>

                    I am also incredibly glad I took a class on human centered software design, because of the soft skills learned. Using Gantt Charts,
                    the agile methodology, taking a project from initial storyboarding to user testing and demonstration, and many other skills.

                <p> After graduating, I moved to Colorado with my girlfriend to begin pursuing full time work,
                    while also enjoying the beautiful state. We have visited 4 national parks so far, and several other
                    state and county parks. <br>

                    I am currently working on an app as a means of furthering my portfolio as well as my skills.
                    This is my first app, written in Swift which I am learning as I go. My future plans include creating
                    another web site to further demonstrate both my UX and programming skills.
