                    <h1>Project-grow website</h1>
                    <p class="project-spacing">Project Grow is a local Community Gardening organization, who we partnered with
                    to create a brand-new website that would meet all of their needs. The site is written in HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, which lets
                    us use the WordPress customization options to allow for easily customizable layouts. Pages include templated layouts
                    that can be added or removed to accomodate the seasonal services they offer, as well as the rotating classes and events.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our team of 5 developers created this website in a semester as our club project. Pages were either designated to a single person
                    or were given to groups of two, which created a sense of teamwork and experience working on projects in small groups.
                    We had regular code reviews to ensure timelines were met, and clean code was added to the repos.

                    boards on the fly and allows playing Sudoku at the command line. Functionality includes playing 4 different difficulties, giving hints,
                    ability to undo moves, see which numbers remain in each row, as well as see statistics about your game play. Being a full screenshot of

                    This included many error-handling measures to ensure that she could easily undo anything she did, and provide an easy to use
                    interface even when she is unfamilar with using a terminal.

                    <h1>Chrome Extension</h1>
                    <p class="project-spacing">As a senior project, myself and a team of 3 others built a chrome extension.
                    The class focused on human centered design, and projects had to include a "Not You" component, meaning the project had 
                    to have end users who differ significantly from us as the developers. We chose to create a time management tool for individuals
                    with ADHD, or other attention disorders. On countdown, chrome tabs could automatically close themselves, ending potential hyper-focus, 
                    a common trait in individuals with ADHD.
                    Over a semester, we covered every step in the project cycle. From initial concepts, to writing Gantt charts,
                    interviewing mock users ith a prototyped product, building, testing, the works. We whiteboarded ideas, features, flex-goals, and ultimately, a clean UI to
                    produce an extension with good UX. 
                    </p>
                    <p>This project was written in HTML, CSS, and primarily JavaScript. (Which if you couldn't tell, <span class="guest-name">Sam</span> I snuck a little
                    JS into this portfolio as well!) I gained experience creating chrome extensions, and 
                    working with various APIs. I have improved my ability to work in a team, as well as how to design for users who differ from myself.

                    <p class="project-spacing">Well <span class="guest-name">Sam</span> this brings us up to the present! After graduating, I decided I wanted to 
                        continue to learn new languages and take on new challenges to keep myself fresh. My current personal project is an iOS app that allows you 
                        to keep track of food in your pantry, fridge, cubbords, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>Users can either take a picture of an individual item's barcode, or, take a picture of their whole receipt and the app will detect the UPC codes
                        printed next to each item, using iOS's Vision and Tesseract. These barcodes are then sent to a barcode API, nutrionix, which returns the products
                        name and image. This information is then used to create customized lists of the users fridge, pantry, etc. Items can be easily added to shopping list 
                        and viewed while away from home as a reminder of what to pick up from the store.

                    <p class="project-spacing">This project is written in swift, and marks my first experience with the language, with only a udemy tutorial to learn the syntax and xcode basics. A special
                        thanks goes to my girlfriend for letting me use her Mac because running xcode in a virtual mac was simply painful and I never would have even gotten the project
                        created before it crashed.

                    <p>Went through a four week camp to learn properties and good coding style of HTML and CSS, along
                    with an introduction to JavaScript. This portfolio was actually created as a test of the skills we had 
                    just learned. In small groups, portfolios were designed and created, and underwent weekly code review.
                    This is the organization in which I helped develop the website for Project Grow.

                        a Student Manager, I have gained valuable skills such as effectively communicating within 
                        a team, demonstrating my knowledge through helping new employees. I was regularly responsible for the 
                        coordination of all other students to ensure the dining hall was properly staffed in stations, as well as stayed
                        clean. On shift, I was responsible for the safety of students and student employees by making sure COVID protocols 
                        were followed at all times.

                        an experience to as many as five tables at a time throughout the night, and I was twice awarded bi-weekly employee appreciation
