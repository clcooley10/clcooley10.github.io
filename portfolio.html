                Science and a minor in French Language and Studies. I grew up just outside 
                of Ann Arbor so attending UofM was always a goal of mine. Outside of school
                I enjoy playing soccer, roller blading, and hanging out with my housemates.

                    <p class="project-spacing">Project Grow is a local Community Gardening organization, who we partnered with
                    to create a brand-new website that would meet all of their needs. The site is written in HTML, CSS, and PHP, which lets
                    us use the WordPress customization options to allow for easily customizable layouts. Pages include templated layouts
                    that can be added or removed to accomodate the seasonal services they offer, as well as the rotating classes and events.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our team of 5 developers is creating this website in a semester as our project. Pages were either designated to a single person
                    or were given to groups of two, which created a sense of teamwork and experience working on projects in small groups.
                    A link will be made available when it is finished.

                    playing Sudoku at the command line. Functionality includes playing 4 different difficulties, giving hints,
                    ability to undo moves, see which numbers remain in each row, as well as see statistics about your game play. Future goals include
                    creating a server which would allow statistics to persist across games, as well as a website which could host the game to create 
                    a more customizable layout than is offered at the command line.

                    <p>This was created as a gift for my girlfriend. It is written in python and was developed to be as user-friendly as possible.
                    This included many error-handling measures to ensure that she could easily undo anything she did, and provide an easy to use
                    interface even when she is unfamilar with using a terminal.

                    <p>Went through a four week camp to learn properites and good coding style of HTML and CSS, along
                    with an introduction to JavaScript. This portfolio was actually created as a test of the skills we had 
                    just learned. In small groups, portfolios were designed and created, and underwent weekly code review.
                    Now, a team of four other developers have a semester project, details of which are in the projects section.

                        a Student Manager, I have gained valuable skills such as effectively communicating within 
                        a team, demonstrating my knowledge through helping new employees. I was regularly responsible for the 
                        coordination of all other students to ensure the dining hall was properly staffed in stations, as well as stayed
                        clean. On shift, I was responsible for the safety of students and student employees by making sure COVID protocols 
                        were followed at all times.

                    <p>Started as a food-runner with little expectation, but management was very impressed by my work ethic and quick learning
                        of both the menu and their culture. Within four weeks, I was serving for the first time. I was responsible for selling 
                        an experience to as many as five tables at a time throughout the night, and I was twice awarded bi-weekly employee appreciation
                        awards for my work ethic and willingness to stay late to help close.
